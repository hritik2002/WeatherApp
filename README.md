# WeatherApp
This is a React Native project , where I have used an API (OpenWeather API ) to get weather data of a city .
I have used AsyncStorage to store data i.e entered city name by user into the local storage of device so that the data is not lost once I close my application.
I have used BottomTab navigation to navigate between the two Screens .
you can learn more about  bottmTab navigator from here https://reactnavigation.org/docs/bottom-tab-navigator/
